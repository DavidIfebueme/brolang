# brolang
web3 dsl that compiles to python and lets you interact with the blockchain
why? because python is peak dev but not everyone thinks so and solidity is just javascript all over again

**brolang** is a custom crypto-bro-inspired scripting language that compiles to python and lets you interact with the blockchain like a proper degen. write web3 interactions in the only syntax that truly matters: **crypto bro**

## what is this?
A dsl (domain-specific language) that lets you write things like:

```brolang
wagmi wallet "0xdeadbeef..."

send_it "mint" with "Diamond Hands NFT", 1000

if fud:
    bail

otherwise:
    pump it "setPrice" with 420.69
```
and under the hood, it compiles to python + web3.py code that interacts with smart contracts.
deploy nfts, vote on daos, transact eth.
